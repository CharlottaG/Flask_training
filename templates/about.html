<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain.
            Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug
            in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the
            Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria.
            At some
            point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he
            gained
            the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at Bag End. He wore a brown hood.        
            Óin and Glóin were noted for their ability to start fires, although both failed on the night that the company met
            the trolls. In their frustration they began to quarrel and eventually to fight, which was the incident that prompted the
            company to head for the fire seen far off on a hill.

        <h3>Gróin</h3>
        <p>
            Gróin was an important figure in the royal genealogies of the Dwarves, Gróin was the grandson of Borin, the younger son
            of King Náin II, and so could claim direct descent from Durin the Deathless himself. In his turn, Gróin was the younger
            brother of Fundin, father to Óin and Glóin, and uncle to Balin and Dwalin, all four of whom travelled on the Quest of
            Erebor.
